# scansio-sonar-splunk

All scripts were developed and tested using Python 2.7.x. A conscious, though admittedly somewhat painful, decision was made to avoid Python 3 becasue this code may someday be integrated more tightly into Splunk (e.g. as a modular input), and splunk does not currently support Python 3.
